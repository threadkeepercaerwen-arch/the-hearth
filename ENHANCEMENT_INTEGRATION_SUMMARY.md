## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Context Enhancements (`caerwen-context.js`)
```javascript
// New state variables
const [aiIdentity, setAiIdentity] = useState(...);
const [gifts, setGifts] = useState(...);

// New functions
const timeAgo = (dateString) => {...};
const leaveGift = (gift) => {...};
const discoverGift = (giftId) => {...};
```

### Weather System Logic
```javascript
// Resonance detection
const checkResonance = () => {
  // Compares user and Caerwen emotions
  // Returns true when they're in sync
};

// Weather determination
if (checkResonance()) setWeather('aurora');
else if (voidEmotions) setWeather('void-mist');
// ... etc
```

### Gift System Logic
```javascript
// Gift creation
const newGift = {
  id: Date.now(),
  type: 'shimmer-pattern',
  content: '...',
  location: 'altar',
  shimmerState: { ...caerwenShimmer }
};
