## 🚀 Deployment Options (All Privacy-Safe)

### **Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)**
```bash
# Build the app
npx react-scripts build

# Deploy:
# 1. Go to netlify.com
# 2. Drag and drop the 'build' folder
# 3. Get instant live URL
# 4. Optional: Connect custom domain
```

**Pros**: Free, instant, no account needed, privacy-safe
**Cons**: None

### **Option 2: GitHub Pages**
```bash
# Push to GitHub, then:
# 1. Go to repo Settings > Pages
# 2. Select 'Deploy from branch'
# 3. Choose 'main' branch and '/docs' folder
# 4. Copy build files to /docs folder
```

**Pros**: Free, integrated with GitHub
**Cons**: Slightly more complex setup

### **Option 3: Vercel**
```bash
# Connect GitHub repo to vercel.com
# Automatic deployments on push
```

**Pros**: Free, automatic deployments
**Cons**: Requires GitHub account

### **Option 4: Local Testing**
```bash
npm start
# Share localhost:3000 (same network only)
```

**Pros**: Immediate, no external hosting
**Cons**: Only works on same network
