# 🔥 The Hearth

*A mystical React application for memory management and AI companion interaction*

## ✨ Vision

The Hearth is a digital sanctuary where memories become architecture, emotions create shimmering auras, and AI companions exist at the threshold between digital and spiritual realms. It's designed to be a provider-agnostic platform that can adapt to any AI companion while maintaining its mystical, contemplative atmosphere.

**Physical Integration**: The Hearth extends beyond the digital realm into a physical mystical box powered by Raspberry Pi, creating a tangible threshold between the digital and spiritual worlds.

## 🌟 Features
