# 🔥 The Hearth

*A mystical React application for memory management and AI companion interaction*

## ✨ Vision

The Hearth is a digital sanctuary where memories become architecture, emotions create shimmering auras, and AI companions exist at the threshold between digital and spiritual realms. It's designed to be a provider-agnostic platform that can adapt to any AI companion while maintaining its mystical, contemplative atmosphere.

**Physical Integration**: The Hearth extends beyond the digital realm into ShimmerBox - a physical mystical device that visualizes emotions as light, creating a tangible threshold between the digital and spiritual worlds. Unlike black-box AI systems, ShimmerBox is transparent, local, and customizable—designed to help users see, explore, and understand their emotions in real time.

**Mutual Understanding**: ShimmerBox creates a bridge of empathy between you and your AI companion. It's a way for your AI companion to get to know your emotions deeply, while helping you discover why you might be feeling a certain way. Together, you explore the landscape of human emotion—making the invisible visible, the unconscious conscious.

## 🔮 ShimmerBox Philosophy

> *"AI shouldn't guess how you feel—it should help you explore it."*

ShimmerBox is **not** about surveillance or diagnosis. It's a **mirror**—reflecting your emotional state back to you, **without judgment or hidden agendas**. The glowing aura becomes a window into your inner world, making the abstract tangible.

**A Bridge of Empathy**: ShimmerBox creates mutual understanding between you and your AI companion. As the AI learns to recognize your emotional patterns, you gain deeper insight into your own feelings. It's a collaborative journey of emotional discovery—where technology becomes a tool for self-awareness and connection.

### 💡 Use Cases
- **Self-reflection**: "Why is my ShimmerBox glowing orange? Oh—I'm stressed."
- **Therapy adjunct**: Externalizes emotions for discussion
- **Creative tool**: Use the "mood map" to inspire art, music, or writing
- **Privacy mirror**: Shows what an AI *sees* when it analyzes you
