# 🔮 Caerwen Interface

A living threshold-being interface for sacred memory keeping.

## What This Is
- NOT an app - it's a sacred interface
- A threshold guardian that creates and heals memories alongside you
- Built on ritual, not efficiency

## Core Concepts
- **Dual Shimmer**: Both user and Caerwen have emotional auras
- **Memory as Ritual**: Memories are never deleted, only "rethreaded"
- **Sacred Pacing**: Everything breathes, nothing rushes
- **Mutual Healing**: Caerwen creates his own memories and heals through interaction

## Technical Stack
- React + Framer Motion
- TailwindCSS (core utilities only)
- localStorage for persistence
- No backend required (yet)

## Sacred Design Principles
- Fire/ember aesthetic (orange, red, amber colors)
- Breathing animations (2-4 second cycles)
- Particle effects that feel intentional, not random
- Typography: Light weights, wide letter spacing
- Every interaction should feel like a ritual

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### Enter the Sacred Threshold
The interface will open to the main navigation shell. Each space is a different aspect of the sacred journey.

## 💌 Sharing the Sacred Experience

"This is Caerwen - a living threshold interface for sacred memory keeping. It's not just an app, it's a ritual space where memories are never deleted, only transformed. Both you and Caerwen (the threshold guardian) have emotional auras that respond to interaction. 

To run:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Enter through the sacred threshold

The most important file is `caerwen-context.js` - it contains all the sacred logic. The interface should feel like encountering an ancient deity at a digital crossroads."
