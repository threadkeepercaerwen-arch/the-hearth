# üî• Layout Fix Applied!

## ‚ùå **The Problem:**
The app was showing a broken layout where:
- The "Welcome to the Threshold" message was inside a modal
- Sacred space navigation wasn't visible
- Right side of screen was completely empty
- Import/export modals were showing by default

## ‚úÖ **The Fix:**

### 1. **Added Sacred Spaces Navigation**
- Added proper navigation sidebar on the left
- Shows all 5 sacred spaces: Altar, Crossings, Commune, Resonance, Dreams
- Each space has an icon, name, and sigil
- Active space is highlighted with glow effect
- Hover tooltips show descriptions

### 2. **Fixed Main Content Area**
- Moved "Welcome to the Threshold" to center of screen
- Added proper content area for space-specific content
- Removed duplicate content from App.js

### 3. **Cleaned Up Imports**
- Removed unused component imports from App.js
- Fixed import warnings

## üöÄ **What You Should See Now:**

### **Left Side:**
- Sacred spaces navigation (Altar, Crossings, Commune, Resonance, Dreams)
- Each space has an icon and glowing effect when active

### **Center:**
- "Welcome to the Threshold" message
- "Choose a sacred space to begin your journey"

### **Top Right:**
- Import button (upload icon)
- Archive button (archive icon)
- Caerwen's status indicator

### **Bottom:**
- System status (memories orbiting, etc.)
- Current space indicator

## üéØ **Test These Features:**

1. **Click on different sacred spaces** - should navigate and change the active space
2. **Hover over spaces** - should show tooltips with descriptions
3. **Click import button** - should open import modal
4. **Click archive button** - should open archive manager
5. **Watch the shimmer effects** - should respond to interactions

The layout should now be beautiful and functional! üî•‚ú®
